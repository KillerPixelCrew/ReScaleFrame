# Unity Mono

`rsf_game_unity_mono` builds `ReScaleFrame.Game.UnityMono.dll` through the existing game-plugin
ABI. It is the shared plugin shell for reflection and Harmony adapters across Unity Mono games.
Drag'n Wash is the first recognized build and URP RenderGraph validation case.

The plugin owns Unity discovery, engine hooks, camera/frame conventions and SR reinsertion.
The shared orchestrator retains vendor SDKs, GPU interoperability and presentation. URP, HDRP
and built-in rendering require separate adapters. IL2CPP is outside the initial Mono adapter.

Detection currently requires the exact x64 Drag'n Wash executable name and SHA256. A different
build remains unknown, including other Unity Mono games. Recognition only establishes identity.
The initial adapter targets Unity 6000.3 URP RenderGraph on native D3D12. Its Mono helper uses
Harmony after complete method-contract preflight; native packets retain GPU resources through
Unity completion fences. Missing runtime services or unsupported players refuse preparation.
Normal loading uses the shared RSF shim, dropped alongside original game files.
`rendering_ready` remains zero while broader scene, resize and hardware acceptance is pending.

Native contract fixtures verify identity, ABI guards and inactive cleanup in a test process.
The shipped-Mono fixture separately exercises managed packet layout, twelve URP method contracts
and Harmony patch/unpatch. Native DX12 vendor readback and live game evidence are recorded in
[the runtime notes](../../docs/research/unity-dx12-runtime-20261004.md).

Current source supplies independent DLSS-G, FSR3/4 and XeSS FG with live provider replacement,
SDK-limited multiplier controls and provider-owned Reflex/XeLL pacing. Unity's SDR pre-UI colour
and normalized depth/motion are captured separately; SR Off/FSR1 also supply FG inputs. Recorded
user acceptance covers XeSS/DLSS-G and the final FSR correction, without establishing higher MFG
counts, all scene/resize paths or Claw operation. See
[shared FG corrections and acceptance](../../docs/research/shared-fg-20261004.md).

```powershell
./eng/verify.ps1 -Configuration Release -VS2026
ctest --preset windows-release-vs18 -R game_unity_mono_plugin_contract

Use the Visual Studio 2022 preset on a machine that has VS 2022. The DLL lands under
`build/windows-x64/bin/<Config>/`.

The managed build requires .NET, the researched player's Managed references, Unity native headers
and locked Harmony 2.4.2; see [dependencies](../../docs/dependencies.md). Deployment defaults to
Auto/Quality with FG Off, backs up owned RSF files and checks original-file hashes. Run deployment
only against a closed game. It copies all FG runtime families even when the default is Off.
The version carrier goes beside `DragNWash.exe`; runtime/plugin/helper/overlay live in `ReScaleFrame/`.
The packager writes a local Claw test ZIP under `.local/packages`, keeps the deployed FG defaults
and excludes preferences, logs, backups and original game files. It does not publish a release.
Unity saves FG provider selection in `ReScaleFrame/preferences.ini`; SR choices remain session
settings over `[UnitySR]` defaults. [Current status](../../docs/current-status.md) records limits.

[Plugin design](../../docs/research/unity-mono-plugin.md) records the inspected methods, proposed
bootstrap, semantic patch guards, native execution and lifecycle requirements.
[First game evidence](../drag-n-wash/engine.json) keeps build identity separate from capability.
